                1. Tell us the differences between uncontrolled and controlled
                components ?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-justify text-gray-500">
                In software engineering, uncontrolled and controlled components
                are two distinct categories of software elements. Uncontrolled
                components are those that are not directly managed by the
                application's code and are instead managed by the browser or
                other external factors. Examples of uncontrolled components
                include form inputs, radio buttons, and checkboxes. Since these
                components are not managed by the application, they do not have
                their own state and rely on the browser to maintain their
                values. Controlled components, on the other hand, are managed by
                the application's code and have their own state. Examples of
                controlled components include text inputs, dropdown menus, and
                date pickers. Since they are controlled by the application's
                code, they can be used to implement more complex behavior, such
                as validation or conditional rendering. The key difference
                between uncontrolled and controlled components is that
                controlled components are more flexible and allow for more
                complex behavior to be implemented, while uncontrolled
                components are simpler and rely on external factors for their
                state.

                2. How to validate React props using PropTypes ?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-justify text-gray-500 bottom-0">
                PropTypes is a package in React that allows developers to
                validate the data types of props passed to a component. It helps
                prevent errors and ensures that the expected data types are
                being passed. To use PropTypes, developers can define the
                PropTypes for a component using the propTypes property, which is
                a key-value map where the keys are the prop names and the values
                are the PropTypes. The isRequired flag can be used to indicate
                that a prop is required. By using PropTypes, developers can make
                their code more reliable and prevent bugs.

              <p className="text-justify text-gray-500 bottom-0">
                Node.js and Express.js are both web development technologies,
                but they serve different purposes. Node.js is a runtime
                environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web
                browser. It allows developers to build server-side applications
                using JavaScript and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O
                model that makes it highly scalable. Express.js, on the other
                hand, is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a
                set of features and tools for building web applications. It
                simplifies the process of building web applications by providing
                a robust set of middleware functions, routing methods, and other
                features that help developers build web servers and APIs. In
                summary, Node.js is the runtime environment for executing
                JavaScript code outside of a web browser, while Express.js is a
                web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of
                features and tools for building web applications.

                4. What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook
                ?
              </h3>
              <p className="text-justify text-gray-500 bottom-0">
                In React, a custom hook is a JavaScript function that allows you
                to reuse logic across multiple components. Custom hooks allow
                developers to abstract away complex logic and provide a simple
                interface for components to consume. Custom hooks are created by
                defining a function that uses one or more built-in hooks or
                other custom hooks and returns a new function that can be used
                in a component. By convention, custom hooks start with the word
                "use". Custom hooks can be used for a variety of purposes, such
                as managing state, handling API requests, or implementing
                animations. They provide a reusable way to encapsulate complex
                logic and allow developers to build more modular and
                maintainable code. Developers may create a custom hook to
                improve code reusability, to keep components simple and focused
                on their specific responsibilities, and to avoid code
                duplication. Additionally, custom hooks can improve code
                organization and make it easier to maintain and test.
